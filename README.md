SUMMARY:
---------
WAF-FLE is a OpenSource ModSecurity Console, allows modsecurity admin
to store, view and search events sent by sensors using a graphical 
dashboard to drill-down and find quickly the most relevant events. It
is designed to be fast and flexible, while keeping a powerful and easy
to use filter, with almost all fields clickable to use on filter.

  * mlogc: in real-time, piped with ModSecurity log, in batch scheduled in crontab

 * Dashboard with recent events information
 * Almost every event data and charts are “clickable” deepening the drill down filter
